# Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms

This repository contains a simulation of argon atoms. The simulation is performed by relating obtained observables of the system to existing literature. 

The project was part of the Computational Physics course at TU Delf performed by Luuk Zonneveld & Miranda Naaktgeboren. Read the [PDF](Luuk_Miranda_Argon_simulation.pdf) for a report of the project.
